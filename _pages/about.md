Research Scientist/Engineer in VUNO.

My interests lie in solving challenges in real-world through artificial intelligence. When I refer to solving
challenges, I emphasize that I try to focus on devising solutions that target the core goal rather than becoming
entangled in miscellaneous points. In real-world, I think the solution should create value for a lot of people. For
artificial intelligence, I believe numerous opportunities lie within AI, enabling the tackling of problems that were
previously deemed impossible.
For the research topic, I am interested in utilizing the capabilities of foundation models to address a diverse range
of tasks, spanning across vision, language, and various other domains. Specifically, my ongoing work is to develop a
system to tackle a wide range of computer vision tasks using vision and language foundation models. In detail, I am
working on developing a system where the model can interpret and solve the vision tasks guided by human
instructions using visual instruction tuning.
Also, I am very dedicated to continuous self-improvement, whether it be in terms of expertise, relationships, or any
other aspect of my life. In order to enhance my personal growth, I think I must increase my acceleration rather
than merely investing time in the endeavor. Thus I consistently think of ways to expedite my growth rate, whether
through altering daily habits, incorporating self-feedback and feedback from others, automating routines, or
exploring new avenues in programming, experimentation, and research.
